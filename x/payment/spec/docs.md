# `x/payment`

## Abstract

The payment module is responsible for paying for arbitrary data that will be added to the Celestia blockchain. While the data being submitted can be arbitrary, the exact placement of that data is important for the transaction to be valid. This is why the payment module utilizes a malleated transaction scheme. Malleated transactions allow for users to create a single transaction, that can later be malleated by the block producer to create a variety of different valid transactions that are still signed over by the user. To accomplish this, users create a single `MsgWirePayForData` transaction, which is composed of metadata and signatures for multiple variations of the transaction that will be included onchain. After the transaction is submitted to the network, the block producer selects the appropriate signature and creates a valid `MsgPayForData` transaction depending on the square size for that block. This new malleated `MsgPayForData` transaction is what ends up onchain.

## State

The payment module doesn't maintain it's own state.

When a PayForData message is processed, it consumes gas based on the message size.

## Messages

- [`MsgWirePayForData`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/29e0a2751182499f7dc03598eabfc8d049ae62cb/x/payment/types/tx.pb.go#L32-L40) is a message that is created and signed by the user but it never ends up on-chain.
- [`MsgPayForData`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/29e0a2751182499f7dc03598eabfc8d049ae62cb/x/payment/types/tx.pb.go#L209-L219) is a "malleated" transaction that is created from metadata in the original `MsgWirePayForData`. `MsgPayForData` does end up on-chain.

## PrepareProposal

The malleation process occurs during the PrepareProposal step.

## Events

- [`NewPayForDataEvent`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/pull/213/files#diff-1ce55bda42cf160deca2e5ea1f4382b65f3b689c7e00c88085d7ce219e77303dR17-R21) is emitted with the signer's address and size of the message that is paid for.

## Parameters

There are no parameters yet, but we might add

- BaseFee
- SquareSize

### Usage

```shell
celestia-app tx payment payForData <hex encoded namespace> <hex encoded data> [flags]
```

### Programmatic Usage

There are tools to programmatically create, sign, and broadcast `MsgWirePayForData`s

```go
// create the raw WirePayForData transaction
wpfdMsg, err := apptypes.NewWirePayForData(block.Header.NamespaceId, message, 16, 32, 64, 128)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// we need to create a signature for each `MsgPayForData`s that
// could be generated by the block producer
// to do this, we create a custom `KeyringSigner` to sign messages programmatically
// which uses the standard cosmos-sdk `Keyring` to sign each `MsgPayForData`
keyringSigner, err := NewKeyringSigner(keyring, "keyring account name", "chain-id-1")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// query for account information necessary to sign a valid tx
err = keyringSigner.QueryAccount(ctx, grpcClientConn)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// generate the signatures for each `MsgPayForData` using the `KeyringSigner`,
// then set the gas limit for the tx
gasLimOption := types.SetGasLimit(200000)
err = pfdMsg.SignShareCommitments(keyringSigner, gasLimOption)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Build and sign the final `WirePayForData` tx that now contains the signatures
// for potential `MsgPayForData`s
signedTx, err := keyringSigner.BuildSignedTx(
    gasLimOption(signer.NewTxBuilder()),
    wpfdMsg,
)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### How the commitments are generated

1. Split the message into shares of `appconsts.ShareSize`
2. Arrange the shares into a Merkle mountain range where each tree in the mountain range has a maximum size of `squareSize`
3. Take the roots of the trees in the Merkle mountain range and create a new Merkle tree. The message share commitment is the Merkle root of this Merkle tree.
